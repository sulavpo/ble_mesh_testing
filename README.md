# ble_mesh_testing
This Flutter app, built using the flutter_blue_plus package, scans and identifies both BLE and BLE Mesh devices. It differentiates between standard BLE and BLE Mesh devices, while also detecting their provisioning status. It serves as a foundation for further exploration of BLE Mesh functionalities like message relaying and secure provisioning.
